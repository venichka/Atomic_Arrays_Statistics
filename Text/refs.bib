However, the realization of integrated nanophotonic systems requires the coupling of emitters to optical cavities and resonators. In this work, we demonstrate hybrid systems in which quantum emitters in 2D hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are deterministically coupled to highquality plasmonic nanocavity arrays. The plasmonic nanoparticle arrays oﬀer a high-quality, low-loss cavity in the same spectral range as the quantum emitters in hBN. The coupled emitters exhibit enhanced emission rates and reduced ﬂuorescence lifetimes, consistent with Purcell enhancement in the weak coupling regime. Our results provide the foundation for a versatile approach for achieving scalable, integrated hybrid systems based on low-loss plasmonic nanoparticle arrays and 2D materials.},

            Understanding strong cooperative optical responses in dense and cold atomic ensembles is vital for fundamental science and emerging quantum technologies. Methodologies for characterizing light-induced quantum effects in such systems, however, are still lacking. Here we unambiguously identify significant quantum many-body effects, robust to position fluctuations and strong dipole–dipole interactions, in light scattered from planar atomic ensembles by comparing full quantum simulations with a semiclassical model neglecting quantum fluctuations. We find pronounced quantum effects at high atomic densities, light close to saturation intensity, and around subradiant resonances. Such conditions also maximize spin–spin correlations and entanglement between atoms, revealing the microscopic origin of light-induced quantum effects. In several regimes of interest, our approximate model reproduces light transmission remarkably well, permitting analysis of otherwise numerically inaccessible large ensembles, in which we observe many-body analogues of resonance power broadening, vacuum Rabi splitting, and significant suppression in cooperative reflection from atomic arrays.},

In this work, motivated by the recent experiment [1], we develop a microscopic quantum treatment using annihilation and creation operator of atoms in deep optical lattices. Using a diagrammatic approach on the Keldysh contour, we derive the cooperative scattering of the light and obtain the general formula for the S matrix. We apply our formulism to study two eﬀects beyond previous treatment with spin operators, the eﬀect of fractional ﬁlling and trapping mismatch. Both eﬀects can lead to the imperfectness of atomic mirrors. For the fractional ﬁlling case, we ﬁnd the cooperative linewidth is linear in ﬁlling fraction n. When there is a mismatch between the trapping potentials for atoms in the ground state and the excited state, multiple resonances can appear in the response function. Our results are consistent with existing experiments.},

	abstract = {We introduce a new theoretical approach for analyzing pump and probe experiments in non-linear acousto-optic systems. In our approach, the effect of coherently pumped polaritons is modeled as providing time-periodic modulation of the system parameters. Within this framework, propagation of the probe pulse is described by the Floquet version of Maxwell's equations and leads to such phenomena as frequency mixing and resonant parametric production of polariton pairs. We analyze light reflection from a slab of insulating material with a strongly excited phonon-polariton mode and obtain analytic expressions for the frequency-dependent reflection coefficient for the probe pulse. Our results are in agreement with recent experiments by Cartella et al. which demonstrated light amplification in resonantly excited SiC insulator. We show that, beyond a critical pumping strength, such systems should exhibit Floquet parametric instability, which corresponds to resonant scattering of the pump polaritons into pairs of finite momentum polaritons. We find that the parametric instability should be achievable in SiC using current experimental techniques and discuss its signatures, including the non-analytic frequency dependence of the reflection coefficient and the probe pulse afterglow. We discuss possible applications of the parametric instability phenomenon and suggest that similar types of instabilities can be present in other photoexcited non-linear systems.},

This effect reflects the amplification of light by phonon-mediated four-wave mixing and, by extension, of optical-phonon fluctuations. Density functional theory calculations clarify aspects of the microscopic mechanism for this phenomenon. The high-frequency dielectric permittivity and the phonon oscillator strength depend quadratically on the lattice coordinate; they oscillate at twice the frequency of the optical field and provide a parametric drive for the lattice mode. Parametric gain in phononic four-wave mixing is a generic mechanism that can be extended to all polar modes of solids, as a means to control the kinetics of phase transitions, to amplify many-body interactions or to control phonon-polariton waves.},

	abstract = {Optical drives at terahertz and mid-infrared frequencies in quantum materials are increasingly used to reveal the nonlinear dynamics of collective modes in correlated many-body systems and their interplay with electromagnetic waves. Recent experiments demonstrated several surprising optical properties of transient states induced by driving, including the appearance of photo-induced edges in the reflectivity in cuprate superconductors, observed both below and above the equilibrium transition temperature. Furthermore, in other driven materials, reflection coefficients larger than unity have been observed. In this paper we demonstrate that unusual optical properties of photoexcited systems can be understood from the perspective of a Floquet system; a system with periodically modulated system parameters originating from pump-induced oscillations of a collective mode. We present a general phenomenological model of reflectivity from Floquet materials, which takes into account parametric generation of excitation pairs. We find a universal phase diagram of drive induced features in reflectivity which evidence a competition between driving and dissipation. To illustrate our general analysis we apply our formalism to two concrete examples motivated by recent experiments: a single plasmon band, which describes Josephson plasmons in layered superconductors, and a phonon-polariton system, which describes upper and lower polaritons in materials such as insulating SiC. Finally we demonstrate that our model can be used to provide an accurate fit to results of phonon-pump - terahertz-probe experiments in the high temperature superconductor \${\textbackslash}rm\{YBa\_2Cu\_3O\_\{6.5\}\}\$. Our model explains the appearance of a pump-induced edge, which is higher in energy than the equilibrium Josephson plasmon edge, even if the interlayer Josephson coupling is suppressed by the pump pulse.},

For this, we ﬁrst derive the electrical ﬁeld in a strongly focused Gaussian light beam, and then consider the atomic response. Following the simple scattering model, the fraction of scattered optical power for a weak coherent probe ﬁeld leads to unphysical scattering ratios above 1 in the strong focusing regime. A reﬁned model considering interference between the exciting and scattered ﬁeld into ﬁnitesized detectors or optical ﬁbers is presented, and compared with experimental extinction measurements for various focusing strengths.},

Such a trend has inevitably aﬀected the research funding market; thus, large state initiatives are taken that are directly expected to drive the formulation of novel research concepts and the development of quantum device prototypes from sensors and circuitry to quantum memory and repeaters. A fundamental operation behind all these applications is the eﬀective steering of electrons, constituting matter waves, along speciﬁc directions and with certain magnitudes, due to development of various reﬂective and refractive orders. The objective of this study is to optimize the simplest structure that supports such anomalous diﬀraction, namely a quantum metasurface comprising cylindrical rods embedded in suitable crystalline matter. Several highly-performing designs from these minimal setups are proven to work exceptionally as multiport components, employable to a variety of quantum engineering implementations.},

	abstract = {Nonreciprocal devices such as isolators and circulators are key enabling technologies for communication systems, both at microwave and optical frequencies. While nonreciprocal devices based on magnetic effects are available for free-space and fibre-optic communication systems, their on-chip integration has been challenging, primarily due to the concomitant high insertion loss, weak magneto-optical effects, and material incompatibility. We show that Kerr nonlinear resonators can be used to achieve all-passive, low-loss, bias-free, broadband nonreciprocal transmission and routing for applications in photonic systems such as chip-scale LIDAR. A multi-port nonlinear Fano resonator is used as an on-chip, all-optical router for frequency comb based distance measurement. Since time-reversal symmetry imposes stringent limitations on the operating power range and transmission of a single nonlinear resonator, we implement a cascaded Fano-Lorentzian resonator system that overcomes these limitations and significantly improves the insertion loss, bandwidth and non-reciprocal power range of current state-of-the-art devices. This work provides a platform-independent design for nonreciprocal transmission and routing that are ideally suited for photonic integration.},

In this review article we survey recent theoretical studies concerning the use of cavity quantum electrodynamics to create quantum many-body systems. Based on recent experimental progress in the fabrication of arrays of interacting micro-cavities and on their coupling to atomic-like structures in several different physical architectures, we review proposals on the realisation of paradigmatic many-body models in such systems, such as the Bose-Hubbard and the anisotropic Heisenberg models. Such arrays of coupled cavities offer interesting properties as simulators of quantum many-body physics, including the full addressability of individual sites and the accessibility of inhomogeneous models.},

	abstract = {Two-dimensional regular arrays of atoms are a promising platform for quantum networks, with collective subradiant states providing long-lived storage and collimated emission allowing for natural coherent links between arrays in free space. However, a single-layer lattice can only efficiently absorb or emit light symmetrically in the forward and backward directions. Here we show how a bilayer lattice can absorb a single photon either incident from a single direction or an arbitrary superposition of forward and backward propagating components. The excitation can be stored in a subradiant state, transferred coherently between different subradiant states, and released, again in an arbitrary combination of highly collimated forward and backward propagating components. We explain the directionality of single and bilayer arrays by a symmetry analysis based on the scattering parities of different multipole radiation components of collective excitations. The collective modes may exhibit the conventional half-wave loss of fields near the array interface or completely eliminate it. The proposed directional control of absorption and emission paves the way for effective one-dimensional quantum communication between multiple arrays, with single-photons propagating backward and forward between quantum information-processing and storage stages.},

	abstract = {By analyzing the parameters of electronic transitions, we show how bosonic Sr atoms in planar optical lattices can be engineered to exhibit optical magnetism and other higher-order electromagnetic multipoles that can be harnessed for wavefront control of incident light. Resonant \${\textbackslash}lambda{\textbackslash}simeq 2.6{\textbackslash}mu\$m light for the \${\textasciicircum}3D\_1{\textbackslash}rightarrow \{{\textasciicircum}3\}P\_0\$ transition mediates cooperative interactions between the atoms while the atoms are trapped in a deeply subwavelength optical lattice. The atoms then exhibit collective excitation eigenmodes, e.g., with a strong cooperative magnetic response at optical frequencies, despite individual atoms having negligible coupling to the magnetic component of light. We provide a detailed scheme to utilize excitations of such cooperative modes consisting of arrays of electromagnetic multipoles to form an atomic Huygens' surface, with complete \$2{\textbackslash}pi\$ phase control of transmitted light and almost no reflection, allowing nearly arbitrary wavefront shaping. In the numerical examples, this is achieved by controlling the atomic level shifts of Sr with off-resonant \$\{{\textasciicircum}3P\}\_J{\textbackslash}rightarrow \{{\textasciicircum}3D\}\_1\$ transitions, which results in a simultaneous excitation of arrays of electric dipoles and electric quadrupoles or magnetic dipoles. We demonstrate the wavefront engineering for a Sr array by realizing the steering of an incident beam and generation of a baby-Skyrmion texture in the transmitted light via a topologically nontrivial transition of a Gaussian beam to a Poincar{\textbackslash}'\{e\} beam, which contains all possible polarizations in a single cross-section.},

	abstract = {Fully inverted atoms placed at exactly the same location synchronize as they deexcite, and light is emitted in a burst (known as "Dicke's superradiance"). We investigate the role of finite interatomic separation on correlated decay in mesoscopic chains, and provide an understanding in terms of collective jump operators. We show that the superradiant burst survives at small distances, despite Hamiltonian dipole-dipole interactions. However, for larger separations, competition between different jump operators leads to dephasing, suppressing superradiance. Collective effects are still significant for arrays with lattice constants of the order of a wavelength, and lead to a photon emission rate that decays nonexponentially in time. We calculate the two-photon correlation function and demonstrate that emission is correlated and directional, as well as sensitive to small changes in the interatomic distance. These features can be measured in current experimental setups, and are robust to realistic imperfections.},
